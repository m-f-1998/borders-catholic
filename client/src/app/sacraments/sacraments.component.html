                        The Sacraments are outward signs instituted by Christ which confer grace.  According to St. Thomas Aquinas, the Sacraments are also “signs in protestation [declaration] of the faith” (S.T. III, q. 61, a. 4, c).  Sacramentals, for their part, are “things or actions which the Church uses in a certain imitation of the Sacraments, in order, in virtue of her prayers, to achieve effects, above all of a spiritual nature” (CIC/17, §1144).
                        <br /><br />On this page you will find enquiry forms which can be sent to us if you wish to recieve a Sacrament within our parish. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to get in touch with us.
                        <br /><br />May God bless you and we hope you will visit one of our churches soon.

It is alluded to indeed by Mark (6:13), but is recommended to the faithful and promulgated by James the apostle and brother of the Lord…

                        Is any among you sick? Let him call for the elders of the church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord; and the prayer of faith will save the sick man, and the Lord will raise him up; and if he has committed sins, he will be forgiven (Jas 5:14-15).

                        The sacrament of Anointing of the Sick is given to those who are seriously ill by anointing them on the forehead and hands with duly blessed oil – pressed from olives or from other plants – saying, only once: 'Through this holy anointing may the Lord in his love and mercy help you with the grace of the Holy Spirit. May the Lord who frees you from sin save you and raise you up.'

                        Going into hospital? If you are going into hospital for a serious operation and would like to receive the Anointing of the Sick beforehand, please contact the priest.

                        Sick at home? If you or anyone you know is sick at home and would like a visit please don’t hesitate to get in touch. The priest will be happy to arrange to come and see you and bring Communion if appropriate." />
